# mdx - Execute your Markdown Code Blocks

Imagine you have the following Markdown file to document your commands:


    # demo.md
    ## [simple_echo]() - Simple echo in shell

    ```sh
    echo "hello world"
    ```

With `mdx` you execute the `sh` code block:

```
% mdx simple_echo
hello world
```
